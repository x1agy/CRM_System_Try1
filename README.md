To start application need to install json-server package, pull repo, write $ cd CRM_System_Try1 and start it with command: 
(your dashes can split, if that happen you need to write two dashes("-") before "watch") 
"$ json-server --watch ./src/DataBase/dt.json -p 8000"  and change "components" folder to "Components" (changed first letter to upper case), i cant commit that change or fix it cause my windows stolen
